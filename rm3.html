    <p>The doll on the left is a scholar; she carries a book in her right hand. She is supposed to have more accessories, but she was only found with one. The doll on the right was my first doll, the one I mentioned in the about section. She had many dresses, but the one I put her in was from another collection of dresses I found. It is difficult to find porcelain dolls with unique expressions like hers.
